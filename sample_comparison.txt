# Question:
A geothermal power plant has three geothermal wells (A, B, and C) with maximum sustainable capacities of A: 1000 units, B: 1500 units, and C: 2000 units. The maximum operating capacity of the power generation equipment is 3000 units. To maintain the pressure in the geothermal field, some of the used hot water or steam needs to be reinjected underground, with a reinjection ratio requirement of 40%. The unit extraction costs for each geothermal well are A: 5 units, B: 4 units, and C: 3 units, and the environmental protection cost is 2 units. Assuming the electricity market demand for a time period t is 2800 units, and each unit of electricity generation brings 1 unit of revenue.

How should the extraction quantities of the three geothermal wells be scheduled to meet the electricity market demand while maximizing revenue and minimizing costs? Design a scheduling plan and calculate the maximum total revenue.

# Response:

COMPLETION:
## Mathematical Model:
To solve the optimization problem for the geothermal power plant, we need to build a mathematical model to maximize total revenue while satisfying constraints such as electricity market demand, maximum well capacity, equipment operating capacity, reinjection ratio, etc. The model can be formulated as follows:

### Decision Variables:
- \(x_i\): The extraction quantity of geothermal well \(i\), where \(i\) represents the geothermal wells (A, B, C).

### Objective Function:
- Maximize total revenue: \[Z = \sum_{i \in \{A, B, C\}} (x_i - \text{cost}_i \cdot x_i - \text{environmental cost} \cdot x_i)\]
  - This function calculates the total revenue of all geothermal wells considering the extraction costs and environmental protection costs.

### Constraints:
1. Electricity market demand is met: \[\sum_{i \in \{A, B, C\}} x_i = 2800\]
   - This ensures that the sum of the extraction quantities of all geothermal wells equals the electricity market demand.
2. Maximum well capacity constraint: \[x_i \leq \text{maximum capacity}_i, \forall i\]
   - This ensures that the extraction quantity of each geothermal well does not exceed its maximum sustainable capacity.
3. Equipment operating capacity constraint: \[\sum_{i \in \{A, B, C\}} x_i \leq 3000\]
   - This ensures that the sum of the extraction quantities of all geothermal wells does not exceed the maximum operating capacity of the power generation equipment.
4. Reinjection ratio constraint: \[\sum_{i \in \{A, B, C\}} x_i \cdot \text{reinjection ratio} \leq \sum_{i \in \{A, B, C\}} x_i\]
   - This ensures that the proportion of used hot water or steam reinjected underground does not exceed 40%.

### Non-negativity constraint:
- \(x_i \geq 0\), for all \(i\), ensures that the extraction quantities of the geothermal wells are non-negative.

Using this model, we can apply linear programming techniques to find the optimal scheduling strategy for the geothermal wells, meeting electricity market demand, adhering to maximum well capacity, equipment operating capacity, reinjection ratio, etc., while maximizing total revenue. This will provide the geothermal power plant with an economically efficient operational strategy.

## Python Code Solution Using `coptpy`:
Below is a Python script using the `coptpy` library to solve the optimization and scheduling problem for the geothermal power plant:

```python
import coptpy as cp
from coptpy import COPT

# Create a COPT environment
env = cp.Envr()

# Create a model
model = env.createModel("GeothermalPowerPlantScheduling")

# Define decision variables
x_A = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=1000, name="x_A")  # Extraction quantity of well A
x_B = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=1500, name="x_B")  # Extraction quantity of well B
x_C = model.addVar(lb=0, ub=2000, name="x_C")  # Extraction quantity of well C

# Define the objective function
model.setObjective(x_A + x_B + x_C - 5*x_A - 4*x_B - 3*x_C - 2*(x_A + x_B + x_C), sense=COPT.MAXIMIZE)

# Add constraints
model.addConstr(x_A + x_B + x_C == 2800, name="MarketDemand")  # Electricity market demand constraint
model.addConstr(x_A + x_B + x_C <= 3000, name="EquipmentCapacity")  # Equipment operating capacity constraint
model.addConstr(0.4*(x_A + x_B + x_C) <= x_A + x_B + x_C, name="ReinjectionRatio")  # Reinjection ratio constraint

# Solve the model
model.solve()

# Output the results
if model.status == COPT.OPTIMAL:
    print("Maximum total revenue: {:.2f}".format(model.objval))
    print("Scheduling plan:")
    print(f"Extraction quantity of well A: {x_A.x}")
    print(f"Extraction quantity of well B: {x_B.x}")
    print(f"Extraction quantity of well C: {x_C.x}")
else:
    print("No optimal solution found.")
```

In this script:

1. First, we create a COPT environment and model.

2. Then, we define three decision variables `x_A`, `x_B`, and `x_C`, representing the extraction quantities of geothermal wells A, B, and C, respectively. We set lower bounds of 0 and upper bounds based on the maximum sustainable capacities of each well.

3. Next, we define the objective function, which is to maximize the total revenue. The total revenue is calculated as the sum of extraction quantities minus extraction costs and environmental protection costs.

4. We add three constraints:
   - Electricity market demand constraint: The sum of the extraction quantities of all geothermal wells equals 2800 units.
   - Equipment operating capacity constraint: The sum of the extraction quantities of all geothermal wells does not exceed 3000 units.
   - Reinjection ratio constraint: The proportion of used hot water or steam reinjected underground does not exceed 40%.

5. Finally, we solve the model and output the maximum total revenue and the optimal scheduling plan (extraction quantities of each geothermal well).

This script provides an optimal scheduling strategy for the geothermal power plant, maximizing total revenue while meeting electricity market demand and other operational constraints.
